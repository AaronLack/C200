In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore 
of the Hudson,
at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch
navigators the Tappan Zee,
and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection 
of St. Nicholas when
they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some 
is called Greensburgh,
but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. 
This name was given,
we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent 
country, from the inveterate
propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market 
days. Be that as it may,
I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of 
being precise and authentic.
Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little 
valley or rather lap of land
among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. 
A small brook glides
through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the 
occasional whistle of a quail
or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in 
upon the uniform tranquillity.
